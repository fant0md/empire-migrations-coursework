These major phases are associated with shifts in population settlement patterns as population concentrates in urban centers in response to the need for greater social and economic interaction during the early stages of development and then deconcentrates as improved transportation and communication permit much of the increased interaction to be performed at a distance. While much migration occurs during these major phases of population redistribution, some aspects of migration involve relatively minor shifts in population within a given settlement pattern. Other migration flows may lead to no population shifts but are important to study as ‘turnover’ migration providing an indication of the degree of integration of the labor markets throughout the society. Migration, population redistribution, and population settlement patterns are closely related phenomena that would benefit from a unified theoretical framework.},

In this study we employ regression analysis to examine the magnitudes in which various factors influenced intercounty migration in England and Wales during the Nineteenth Century. Our evidence suggests that out-migration tended to be lower the higher the agricultural wage that prevailed in a county.

Comparisons with the 1841 census indicate that transported convicts were broadly representative both of the English prison population and of the non-criminal working class. Almost one-third of the workers in the sample moved between counties. The working-class intercounty migrant was young, literate and skilled; the median distance travelled was 59 miles. Regional migration pathways are described. Rural workers moved more frequently than urban workers, but urban workers travelled a greater median distance than their rural counterparts. Estimating a gravity-flow migration model, migration is found to be highly sensitive to intercounty job opportunities and wage rate differentials, but relatively insensitive to distance (which acted as a deterrent to movement). While regional biases existed, the regression results imply that labour market signals were effective in transferring labour from rural to urban locations.},

This is the case of genealogy trees, which flourish on numerous digital platforms thanks to the collaboration of a mass of individuals wishing to trace their origins and share them with other users. The family trees constituted in this way contain information on the links between individuals and their ancestors, which can be used in historical demography, and more particularly to study migration phenomena. This article proposes to use the family trees of 238, 009 users of the Geneanet website, or 2.5 million (unique) individuals, to study internal migration. The case of 19th century France is taken as an example. Using the geographical coordinates of the birthplaces of individuals born in France between 1800 and 1804 and those of their descendants, we study migration between generations at several geographical scales. We start with a broad scale, that of the departments, to reach a much finer one, that of the cities. Our results are consistent with those of the literature traditionally based on parish or civil status registers. The results show that the use of collaborative genealogy data not only makes it possible to recover known facts in the literature, but also to enrich them.},

We propose that this dramatic migration was rooted in institutional changes initiated by the 1906 Stolypin land titling reform. One might expect better property rights to decrease the propensity to migrate by improving economic conditions in the reform area. However, this titling reform increased land liquidity and actually promoted migration by easing financial constraints and decreasing opportunity costs. Treating the reform as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ difference-in-differences analysis on a panel of province-level data that describe migration and economic conditions. We find that the reform had a sizeable effect on migration. To verify the land liquidity effect, we exploit variation in the number of households participating in the reform. This direct measure of the reform mechanism estimates that land liquidity explains approximately 18\% of migration during this period.},

While fitting gravity models of aggregate migration flows started taking backstage to microdata analysis in the 1980s, a recent comeback has resulted from increasing applications to international migration and from the emergence of statistical theories appropriate for studying spatial interaction. In this paper we review the status quo and argue for greater integration of internal and international migration modelling. Additionally we revisit the issues of parameter stability and distance deterrence measurement by means of a New Zealand case study. We argue that gravity modelling of migration has a promising future in a multi‐regional stochastic population projection system – an area in which the model has been to date surprisingly underutilised. We conclude with outlining current challenges and opportunities in this field.},

Migration is, however, constrained by the lack of liquidity; for the poorest regions, an increase in income raises rather than decreases outmigration. Our estimates imply that up to a third of Russian regions are locked in poverty traps.},

The widespread decline in migration rates across a large number of subpopulations suggests that broad-based economic forces are likely responsible for the decrease. An obvious question is the extent to which the recent housing market contraction and the recession may have caused this downward trend in migration: after all, relocation activity often involves both housing market activity and changes in employment. However, we find relatively small roles for both of these cyclical factors. While we will suggest a few other possible explanations for the recent decrease in migration, the puzzle remains. Finally, we compare U.S. migration to other developed countries. Despite the steady decline in U.S. migration, the commonly held belief that Americans are more mobile than their European counterparts still appears to hold true.},

Using per-capita GDP as a proxy for income and as an indicator of economic development, we find that migration in Indonesia is indeed directed towards more developed regions. This finding supports the notion that regional disparities in development are an important factor in interregional migration in Indonesia. In line with classical gravity models, our findings show that distance is negatively related to the size of migration flows. However, unlike previous studies of interprovincial migration in Indonesia, we find that the effect of distance has weakened over time.},

Underutilized tabulations from the 1989 census and national statistical data on characteristics of provinces were explored to gain insights into the roles of development in interprovincial migration within a context of institutional intervention. The overall results of OLS regression indicate that more developed provinces attracted higher volumes of inmigrants, whereas less developed provinces produced more outmigrants, other things being equal. Most of the migrants, especially females, moved to more urbanized and industrialized areas, regardless of their origin home provinces. The government's organized population movements towards remote resettlement areas were costly from the view of the migrants. The study results suggest the importance of interpreting population movement in Vietnam within the broader context of its current transition to a market economy.

The analysis finds that average migration between neighboring districts in the same state is at least 50\% larger than neighboring districts on different sides of a state border, even after accounting for linguistic differences. Although the impact of state borders differs by education, age and reason for migration, it is always large and significant. The article suggests that inter-state mobility is inhibited by state-level entitlement schemes, ranging from access to subsidized goods through the public distribution system to the bias for states’ own residents in access to tertiary education and public sector employment.},

In addition, our regression analysis demonstrates that the urban primacy of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, had a strong effect on the direction and size of migration flows. Our findings thus suggest that the costly government-supported migration is not very successful and that a strongly centralized government induces migration flows to the capital.

This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory. However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts. By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies – which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels – this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration-development interactions. The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self-help development “from below”. These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.},

Assuming increasing returns and perfect capital mobility, the driving forces behind labor migration are the size and the composition of the workforce. The size of the workforce produces divergence: a larger workforce in one country implies higher wages, the wage gap induces in-migration and this makes the wage gap even larger. In this case migration is only beneficial for the labor importing country. The evolution in the composition of the workforce due to migration may have opposite effects. In one case in-migration keeps the wage of skilled workers high enough to induce people to qualify for skilled jobs. This improves the composition of labor in the receiving country only and it makes divergence a likely outcome. In another case labor migration keeps the relative wage of unskilled workers in the rich country high enough to induce all migrants to take unskilled jobs and reduce the skilled-to-unskilled ratio in that country. Then, migration is beneficial to the country which was first exporting labor.},

We find that entry barriers and monopoly power in the non-agricultural sector were the most important reason for Tsarist Russia’s failure to industrialize before World War I. Soviet industrial transformation after 1928 was achieved primarily by reducing such frictions, albeit coinciding with a significantly lower performance of productivity in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.

Until now, migration and development have constituted separate policy fields. Differing policy approaches that hinder national coordination and international cooperation mark these fields. For migration authorities, the control of migration flows to the European Union and other OECD countries are a high priority issue, as is the integration of migrants into the labour market and wider society. On the other hand, development agencies may fear that the development policy objectives are jeopardized if migration is taken into consideration. Can long?term goals of global poverty reduction be achieved if short?term migration policy interests are to be met? Can partnership with developing countries be real if preventing further migration is the principal European migration policy goal? While there may be good reasons to keep some policies separate, conflicting policies are costly and counter?productive. More importantly, there is unused potential in mutually supportive policies, that is, the constructive use of activities and interventions that are common to both fields and which may have positive effects on poverty reduction, development, prevention of violent conflicts, and international mobility. This paper focuses on positive dimensions and possibilities in the migration?development nexus. It highlights the links between migration, development, and conflict from the premise that to align policies on migration and development, migrant and refugee diasporas must be acknowledged as a development resource.},
