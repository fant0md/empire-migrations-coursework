	%abstract = {This book presents estimates of the growth of the tsarist economy during the 'industrialization era', 1885–1913. The performance of the tsarist economy is compared with that of Soviet Russia during the plan era and of other industrialized countries during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its main importance is to provide a frame of reference against which to contrast the Soviet performance. The author finds a stronger performance from the tsarist economy than the literature had led us to suspect, and he disputes several of the established views of economic historians concerning Russian agriculture and the Russian nineteenth-century business cycle.},

	%abstract = {Major phases of population redistribution include initial urbanization, frontier expansion, traditional urbanization, overurbanization, suburbanization, and metropolitan-to-non-metropolitan turnaround. These major phases are associated with shifts in population settlement patterns as population concentrates in urban centers in response to the need for greater social and economic interaction during the early stages of development and then deconcentrates as improved transportation and communication permit much of the increased interaction to be performed at a distance. While much migration occurs during these major phases of population redistribution, some aspects of migration involve relatively minor shifts in population within a given settlement pattern. Other migration flows may lead to no population shifts but are important to study as ‘turnover’ migration providing an indication of the degree of integration of the labor markets throughout the society. Migration, population redistribution, and population settlement patterns are closely related phenomena that would benefit from a unified theoretical framework.},

I reconstruct gross regional products and labor productivity for all provinces of the empire around 1900 for the first time. My estimates highlight substantial heterogeneity within a middle-income country. I show that both natural advantages – sea access, mineral resources, land abundance – and institutions, in particular the legacy of serfdom, account for the observed variation. I also provide evidence that market potential and specialization externalities played a role.},

	%abstract = {Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many econometric applications have neglected an important implication of it: under heteroskedasticity, the parameters of log-linearized models estimated by OLS lead to biased estimates of the true elasticities. We explain why this problem arises and propose an appropriate estimator. Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

	%abstract = {We document substantial increases in agricultural productivity, industrial output, and peasants' nutrition in Imperial Russia as a result of the abolition of serfdom in 1861. Before the emancipation, provinces where serfs constituted the majority of agricultural laborers lagged behind provinces that primarily relied on free labor. The emancipation led to a significant but partial catch up. Better incentives of peasants resulting from the cessation of ratchet effect were a likely mechanism behind a relatively fast positive effect of reform on agricultural productivity. The land reform, which instituted communal land tenure after the emancipation, diminished growth in productivity in repartition communes.},
